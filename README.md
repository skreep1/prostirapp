# Prostir — Your Safe Space for Ideas, Plans, and Habit.

Prostir is a stress-free planner designed to prioritize your well-being. It encourages balance, not burnout, by offering a safe space for your plans and thoughts without unnecessary pressure, which is how we differ from most other apps. With thoughtful features, Prostir simplifies planning, helping you stay organized with ease and peace of mind.

We’ve noticed that most planning apps are quite similar, but many of them create pressure on users. That’s why our concept is to provide a safe space where everyone can find room for their tasks, thoughts, and habits without judgment or coercion. Instead, they get support, understanding, and freedom.

Ideas for projects usually come from observing what could improve people’s lives. I always analyze the challenges I face personally or hear about from others and think about how technology could solve them. In the case of Prostir, the key was to create a product that helps people maintain balance and avoid burnout.
